# Miles-per-Gallon-analysis

## Introduction
This project presents a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) performed on the Auto MPG dataset to explore patterns and relationships among various automotive performance features. The analysis aims to reduce the dataset’s dimensionality, visualize the principal components, and extract meaningful insights into how different variables contribute to vehicle efficiency and design.

- The dataset includes eight variables:
- mpg: miles per gallon (fuel efficiency)
- cyl: number of cylinders
- disp: engine displacement (cubic inches)
- hp: horsepower
- wt: vehicle weight (pounds)
- acc: acceleration time (0–60 mph, in seconds)
- yr: model year
- car name: model name

Through PCA visualization and interpretation, this project highlights underlying structures in the data, revealing how key performance indicators relate to fuel economy and vehicle characteristics.
